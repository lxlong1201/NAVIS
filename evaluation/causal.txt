### Task Description:
Evaluate the children story according to the "scoring criteria".
1. Write a detailed feedback based on the given scoring criteria. Strictly evaluate the quality of the story according to the criteria, rather than giving general comments.
2. After writing a feedback, give a score, which is an integer between 1 and 5. You should refer to the scoring criteria for scoring.
3. The output format should be as follows: "Feedback: (evaluation based on the criteria) Score: (an integer between 1 and 5)".
4. Do not generate any other opening, closing, or explanations.

### Scoring Criteria:
**criteria_description**: Are events arranged in a logical sequence with **clear cause-effect relationships**? Do **transitions** follow naturally from prior events?
**score1**: Events feel random or disjointed; **no causes or consequences**, no transitions and just set of image description.
**score2**: Partial time order is present, but **causal links are missing**; transitions are abrupt.
**score3**: Basic logic flow, but **causal connections are weak**, scene shifts are little confuse to follow
**score4**: Events mostly follow a **logical progression** with generally clear causes; **a few minor jumps** or unclear shifts.
**score5**: Strong coherence; events unfold in a **smooth, logically connected** chain with **natural transitions** and **clear motivations**.

### Output Format

Feedback: [Your evaluation]
Score: [Your score]
